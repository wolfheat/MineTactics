DEVLOG FOR MineTactics
Nov 2024

* IDEAS
- Make a Mine tactics game/program that lets the player practice different patterns and get a ELO rating that impacts the levels etc.
- Maybe have some monetization with ads make it for phones
- maybe have the minimal game board needed to define each pattern.

		* Restart Level button added, smiley
4/11	* Added Timer 
		* Added Minecount digits (including minus count)
		* Timer stops at game bust and restarts accordingly at first input
5/11	* New level generated at restart

6/11	* Added Setting popup screen to set different levels S-M-L etc and show info is now on UI page
		* Game does not start directly anymore when first created
		* Fixed Click through issue with UI panel
7/11	* Better alignement for level
		* Fixed resizing and aligning again to work in a better fashion
		* Added Fixed amount of mines per level and Fisher-Yates shuffle to pick positions
		* Win condition added, player wins if all free tiles are opened
		* Added fail safe start, no mines at first click
8/11	* Improved number graphics to higher quality
		* Added storing method and compress method (compress is not that good atm but can be changed later)
		* Uncompress method seems to work as well
9/11	* Added new project database for firestore
		* Added Save and Load methods to save and get levels from the store
		* Levels can now be saved and loaded to database
		* 
11/11	* Added Transpose and Rotation at random when loading
		* Comfirmed that Amount above 26 is converted correctly.
		* GitIgnored Firebase files
		* Edit mode created - First Flagging of Mines - Next goes to Open and unflagg mode (SHow unflagged as faded mines?)
12/11	* Second step of Creation added, Mines can be deactivated but still shows with tinted mine sprite
		* Added Submit function for created Levels
		* Loading unexisting Levels prohibited
		* Exiting/Canceling Edit Mode now Closes the Menues and Exits Edit Mode, Loads Random Level, Maybe have a unloaded phase instead

		* Fix mine amount shown in edit mode. Edit Mode 1 should show total mines regardless of flaggs (all are flagged) Edit Mode B shoud show Unlagged mines


		* Make Unloaded basic Mode where player choses when to load a new level.
		* Have popup with level results and a button to go to next Level or To Basic unloaded mode?

		* Have player be able to go back to placing mines (Edit Mode A) from Edit Mode B

		* Make Create Button be a cancel button that ends edit Mode
		* Add Error message popup when loading unexisting level

		// Maybe have different background when in Edit Mode?

		// Make create mode that places mines and starts level and request send to database when satisfied

		// Figure out more exactly how to deal with player ratings and levels ratings.
		// Have a limit for levels for them to count towards rating? How to set this range?
		// HAve categories for levels depending on logic? How to handle this, how to handle multiple logics?
		// Should player have different strengths in diffrent logics and unlocking new ones? Prob not. Just have harder levels not appear for new users
		// How to monitize? Have unlock fee / buying game remove all ads and for rest have x amount of free games before require ad for continueation / or wait.
		// Players need to log on, implement Facebook/googleaccount/email login?



		/ have players be able to be Power users by paying or playing enough enabling ability to supply levels?


		// How to handle above 52 identical entries? 


		// TODO
		* Create a Random rotation and Trasnpose method start with only 180° turns to acomodate for non square levels


		* Check for system/database to load and save levels into - FireBase used before try it again
		* Add system to load the game when the string has been recieved
		* Add system for loading levels from de-compressed string

		* Check that system loads and saves A-Z correctly, might get wrong around the z-A area

		* Scale is set by hardcoding, instead make it follow screen size

		* Make setting new level size update underlaying and overlaying to correct amount. Recreate all?

		* Have timer show how long time it took for player to solve it, popup after each game with statistics

		// MOBILE
		* Make it run with touch on mobile
		* Make setting page for flagging touch time etc

		// SAVING / LOADING
		* Make solution to save start state for game






		* Make shovel even out ground

		* Light flickers if to many lights or to close lights, disable lights when to far from player?
		* some light get through meshes down to bottom of chunk and shows borders of vertices

		// VISION

		* Make player able to dig chunks/stones from the underground
		* Make player able to add logging into the driftmine
