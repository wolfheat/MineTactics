DEVLOG FOR MineTactics
Nov 2024

* IDEAS
- Make a Mine tactics game/program that lets the player practice different patterns and get a ELO rating that impacts the levels etc.

		* Tried Changing Manifest to get it to Run Firebase on Android, but it did not want to open from this
20/11	- Struggled all day trying to get it to run on mobile. Had tons of gradle issues making the build fail for android. Updated project to v 2022.3.53f1
		- Git it to run By deleting the android-35 from the E:\Unity Projects\2022.3.53f1\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\AndroidPlayer\SDK\platforms dir
21/11	* Fixed issue with Firebase and build Gradle issue - solution was to check the MInify boxes in the Android Build Settings - Custom Gradle manifests are enable but not written to
		* Updated the Input system so only new is used for touch
		* Adjusted ResultScreens into different ones depending on GameType
		* Added Loading Screen For Loading Levels from db
		* Fixed first level starting directly when loaded levels complete - Now starts at closing menu
		* Changed so when pressing Next a new Level is Loaded instead of pressing the Random button

		
		* Make Tab step to next Input field when in Login or Register (Not needed for android) Tried no luck

		* Still The Smiley sends player to normal games even when playing Random Loaded ones, should not be this way? How to manage

		* Fix so settings are saved to disk and loaded correctly

		* Fix the error handeling of submitting levels

		* Issues connecting to Firestore on mobile, cant even load levels
		* Add touch timing settings in settings 5-30ms?
		
		* Fix so the Pending checkbox is counting as checked at start - Not needed have it off at start


		* Make the Setting Size Have Single size steps from 5x5 -> 15x15 ??
		
		// TODO
		* Maybe only allow paying players to rate and play pending games?

		// PRO USERS
		* Make it possible to support as patriot, Buy Me a coffie or buying the game / unloading ads 5$?
		* Make Submit button hide when submitted a level.
		* Have creator guess a rating 1-10 which determines the levels start rating

		// MONITIZATION
		* How to monitize? Have unlock fee / buying game remove all ads and for rest have x amount of free games before require ad for continueation / or wait.

		// USER EXPERIENCE
		* Have player be able to favour some levels they want to practice and keep them locally? Have an option to run only favourite levels?
		* Maybe - Make player unable to load same level again for 20 or 50 levels?
		* Figure out more exactly how to deal with player ratings and levels ratings.
		* Have a limit for levels for them to count towards rating? How to set this range?
		* HAve categories for levels depending on logic? How to handle this, how to handle multiple logics?
		* Should player have different strengths in diffrent logics and unlocking new ones? Prob not. Just have harder levels not appear for new users

		// LEVEL CREATION
		* Decide where to go after a Level is submitted
			* Have player be able to go back to placing mines (Edit Mode A) from Edit Mode B
		* Change so placemnt of mines are tinted mines and not flags, rework this
		* Make create mode that places mines and starts level and request send to database when satisfied

		// UI
		* Scale is set by hardcoding, instead make it follow screen size


		// LEVEL CREATION SYSTEM
		* Make setting new level size update underlaying and overlaying to correct amount. Recreate all?


		* Add Error message popup when loading unexisting level
		
		// AUTHENTICATION
		* Players need to be able to log in with Facebook/googleaccount


		// DATABASE
		* Figure out a way to not load to many Levels at a time
		* Maybe have many levels per entry, makes reads a lot fewer if 100 levels are in one read?

		// Cloud Firestore Rules
		* Allow writing if
			- PLayer is power user = paying or playing a lot?
			- Level starts with number between 06-20
			- Status == Pending (Players always place the level in Pending status) Might allow admin status to place as Approved?
			- Upwotes == 0 && Downvotes == 0 - When level is uploaded it has to start at no Votes
			- 
		* Allow updating if
			- Update specific value 
				- Pending -> Approved if Upvotes - DownVotes > 10
				- DifficultRating if newValue >= OldValue -MaxChange &&  newValue <= OldValue +MaxChange 
				- DownVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- UpVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- PlayCount if newValue == OldValue +1 
				-- Do Not allow updating Level, LevelID, CreatorId




		//ISSUES
		* Changeing Size during a Create even breaks the level. Maybe have the level size set at the first creation step?

		* SOLVED - Having this issues with creating new Users for the project
