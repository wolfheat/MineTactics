		// LOOK INTO
		Played your game, latest version got stuck here... https://imgur.com/MahzJjb
		Got stock in wall behind ramiros house

		When picking up stuff from crafters the notice text is under the output panel
		Trying to pick up stuff with full inventory should make different sound and notice player better of failure to do so. Also makes axe sound hitting wood/rock if clicking anywhere
		dragging from anywhere in the inventory+ drags the selected item out into the world to drop, maybe you should require the player to drag from the item.
		Using a tool in a crowded area makes harvesting fail (instead check more than the closest item to see if any is harvestable with the tool)
		spyglass I - is there a version II ?
		consuming a blueberry drink with full inventory (having 2+ drinks) discards the glass - should keep it
		blueberries at camp seems to spawn multiple times making stacks (also seems to happen to some clay and stone)
		failing minigmae cutting wood should have another sound than hitting stone?
		E- to interract and fixing cost does not show at the fireplace at the hilltop or the hill
		maybe sitting should speed up recovery?
		Right clicking a stack in inventory moves all stacks of same type, should only move all of the clicked stack
		Shift clicking items in the inventory changes sprint on/off - which it prob shouldnt
		Trying to fix ramiras farm - gets you unavalible notice but costs you BOUNCE each time
		Minor - When fixing a torch you can light it before it is completed

		Step Sounds are off in the town - wooden floor sound on grass areas a bit random


		- NEW

		NOT AN ISSUE when placing stuff I get option above a stack say for soft wood 190 but when placing only the stack is placed
		Did you spell turmeric wrong by mistake?
		Piñjon adds only 1 bounce instead of 10
		oRES AND mORES selling crystals for 0 sparks (seems that multiple buy screens pop up when there is several items on the table, like crystals		)
		Would be nice to teb out from trade for sparks menu
		Lots of duplicate items, my save ali file was 45.5Mb

		// Moderator Tools
		* What Creation tools should be allowed for users, and when?

		* How to monitize? Have unlock fee / buying game remove all ads and for rest have x amount of free games before require ad for continueation / or wait.

		// USER EXPERIENCE
		* Have player be able to favour some levels they want to practice and keep them locally? Have an option to run only favourite levels?
		* Maybe - Make player unable to load same level again for 20 or 50 levels?
		* Figure out more exactly how to deal with player ratings and levels ratings.
		* Have a limit for levels for them to count towards rating? How to set this range?
		* HAve logic categories for levels? How to handle this, how to handle multiple logics?
		* Should player have different strengths in different logics and unlocking new ones? Prob not. Just have harder levels not appear for new users
		// LEVEL CREATION SYSTEM
		// USER CREATION ALLOWENCE
		* How about having new Pending levels in a pot where players can play and rate them and after 100 ratings it is ether approved or discarded?
		* Approved goes into certain Collections? Maybe Monthly new or Weekly?
		* Initially players get the basic collections maybe 1000 levels? Need to complete them to unlock rest?		
		// PRO USERS
		* Maybe only allow paying players to rate and play pending games?
		* Make it possible to support as patriot, Buy Me a coffie or buying the game / unloading ads 5$?
		* Make Submit button hide when submitted a level.
		* Have creator guess a rating 1-10 which determines the levels start rating
		* Make admin Log in that allowes approved levels directly
		* Make admin Log in that allows upload of Collections?

		// UI

		******************************
		Minesweeper GO Pro Cons

			TheOreh/Opex/0,12,46/220,180,140
		-no ping or delay, game only loads to the server after you win it
		-no cheaters usually (partly cuz of anticheat), or the dev, who has contacts with active players, bans cheaters in a short period of time
		-no incidents when your board moves up and down like on wom mobile
		-tournaments

			Llama
		 The main reason for playing it over different apps is that it has good stats and leaderboards, though WoM also has this. And the reason for playing minesweeper Go 
		 over WoM would be that minesweeper Go is optimised for mobile so is a bit more responsive than WoM. Although this does depend on other factors like what device is used.
		******************************
		
		// DATABASE
		* Figure out a way to not load to many Levels at a time - Introduced Collections
		
		// Cloud Firestore Rules - Also needs in game correlating rules
		* Allow writing if
			- Player is power user = paying or playing a lot?
			- Level starts with number between 06-20
			- Status == Pending (Players always place the level in Pending status) Might allow admin status to place as Approved?
			- Upwotes == 0 && Downvotes == 0 - When level is uploaded it has to start at no Votes
			- 
		* Allow updating if
			- Update specific value 
				- Pending -> Approved if Upvotes - DownVotes > 10
				- DifficultRating if newValue >= OldValue -MaxChange &&  newValue <= OldValue +MaxChange 
				- DownVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- UpVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- PlayCount if newValue == OldValue +1 
				-- Do Not allow updating Level, LevelID, CreatorId

		//ISSUES
		* Changeing Size during a Create even breaks the level. Maybe have the level size set at the first creation step?

		* SOLVED - Having this issues with creating new Users for the project
