		* Having this issues with creating new Users for the project

		* Need to fix issue when busting a level and how to handle that
		* Pressing Next just closes the Result, should it start new level?

		// TODO
		* Maybe only allow paying players to rate and play pending games?

		* Amke it possible to support as patriot, Buy Me a coffie or buying the game / unloading ads 5$?
		* Make Submit button hide when submitted a level.
		* Decide where to go after a Level is submitted
			* Have player be able to go back to placing mines (Edit Mode A) from Edit Mode B
		* Change so placemnt of mines are tinted mines and not flags, rework this
		* Have player be able to favour some levels they want to practice and keep them locally? Have an option to run only favourite levels?
		* Have creator guess a rating 1-10 which determines the levels start rating

		* Have popup with level results and a button to go to next Level or To Basic unloaded mode?
		* Add Error message popup when loading unexisting level
		
		* Make Unloaded basic Mode where player choses when to load a new level. Maybe not. Loading a random local game is sufficient

		// Cloud Firestore Rules

		* Allow writing if
			- PLayer is power user = paying or playing a lot?
			- Level starts with number between 06-20
			- Status == Pending (Players always place the level in Pending status) Might allow admin status to place as Approved?
			- Upwotes == 0 && Downvotes == 0 - When level is uploaded it has to start at no Votes
			- 
		* Allow updating if
			- Update specific value 
				- Pending -> Approved if Upvotes - DownVotes > 10
				- DifficultRating if newValue >= OldValue -MaxChange &&  newValue <= OldValue +MaxChange 
				- DownVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- UpVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- PlayCount if newValue == OldValue +1 
				-- Do Not allow updating Level, LevelID, CreatorId




		//ISSUES
		* Changeing Size during a Create even breaks the level. Maybe have the level size set at the first creation step?
		* Maybe - Make player unable to load same level again for 20 or 50 levels?

		// DATABASE
		* Figure out a way to not load to many Levels at a time
		* Maybe have many levels per entry, makes reads a lot fewer if 100 levels are in one read?

		// Make create mode that places mines and starts level and request send to database when satisfied

		// Figure out more exactly how to deal with player ratings and levels ratings.
		// Have a limit for levels for them to count towards rating? How to set this range?
		// HAve categories for levels depending on logic? How to handle this, how to handle multiple logics?
		// Should player have different strengths in diffrent logics and unlocking new ones? Prob not. Just have harder levels not appear for new users
		// How to monitize? Have unlock fee / buying game remove all ads and for rest have x amount of free games before require ad for continueation / or wait.
		// Players need to log on, implement Facebook/googleaccount/email login?



		/ have players be able to be Power users by paying or playing enough enabling ability to supply levels?


		// How to handle above 52 identical entries? 


		// TODO
		* Create a Random rotation and Trasnpose method start with only 180° turns to acomodate for non square levels


		* Check for system/database to load and save levels into - FireBase used before try it again
		* Add system to load the game when the string has been recieved
		* Add system for loading levels from de-compressed string

		* Check that system loads and saves A-Z correctly, might get wrong around the z-A area

		* Scale is set by hardcoding, instead make it follow screen size

		* Make setting new level size update underlaying and overlaying to correct amount. Recreate all?

		* Have timer show how long time it took for player to solve it, popup after each game with statistics

		// MOBILE
		* Make it run with touch on mobile
		* Make setting page for flagging touch time etc

		// SAVING / LOADING
		* Make solution to save start state for game






		* Make shovel even out ground

		* Make player able to dig chunks/stones from the underground
		* Make player able to add logging into the driftmine
