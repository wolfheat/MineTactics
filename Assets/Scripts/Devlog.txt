		-- Makes most sense to have X amount of standard diff level collections which player can pick from as the standard Challenge mode

		

		// Responsiveness
		* Issue with responsive result screens fix later		
			Result Screens
			Settings
		
		* Only Allow a player to send Rating the first time they encounter a level?
		* Issue - with slow loading of levels in collections sometimes, fix? Still issue?

		// Moderator Tools
		* What Creation tools should be allowed for users, and when?

		// Trouble with Id only unique inside each document not both

		// PLAYERSTATS
		* Add page with statistics for the player?
			* Total games cleared
			* Practice levels completed?
			* Rating?
				
		// MODES
		* Add find missflagged mine Game Mode??				
		* Have some as Optional - Reasonable - Wishful?
		* Mode where there are guesses but the highest prob are always the mines?
		
		
		// PAPER
		* Create Paper on Expected features for the game and Steps to get there?

		// TODO
		* Fix the error handeling of submitting levels

		// MONITIZATION
		* How to monitize? Have unlock fee / buying game remove all ads and for rest have x amount of free games before require ad for continueation / or wait.

		// USER EXPERIENCE
		* Have player be able to favour some levels they want to practice and keep them locally? Have an option to run only favourite levels?

		// RATING
		* Figure out more exactly how to deal with player ratings and levels ratings.
		* Have a limit for levels for them to count towards rating? How to set this range?

		// LEVEL COLLECTIONS
		* Have logic categories for levels? How to handle this, how to handle multiple logics?
		* Should player have different strengths in different logics and unlocking new ones? Prob not. Just have harder levels not appear for new users
		
		// LEVEL CREATION SYSTEM
		// USER CREATION ALLOWENCE
		* How about having new Pending levels in a pot where players can play and rate them and after 100 ratings it is ether approved or discarded?
		* Approved goes into certain Collections? Maybe Monthly new or Weekly?
		* Initially players get the basic collections maybe 1000 levels? Need to complete them to unlock rest?		
		
		// PRO USERS
		* Maybe only allow paying players to rate and play pending games?
		* Make it possible to support as patriot, Buy Me a coffie or buying the game / unloading ads 5$?
		* Make Submit button hide when submitted a level.
		* Have creator guess a rating 1-10 which determines the levels start rating
		* Make admin Log in that allowes approved levels directly
		* Make admin Log in that allows upload of Collections?

		// UI		
		
		// AUTHENTICATION
		* Players need to be able to log in with Facebook/googleaccount
		* Have Log out use Loadingpanel and show result?

		// Look Into Playtest

		// Minor things
		* Drinking bounce giving things whouldnt be allowed if full bounce?
		* The additional clay/stone generated when getting a full success minigame isnt clear. Have it be 100%? Have it given to player directly better or somehow more visual.

		* Have someone directing you to the camp by town to sleep until you get the house sorted?
		* Have the Bed craftable but only placable inside your house
		* Sleeping in bed might give a certain benefit

		* At researchtable unlocking platinum shown twice

		* Would be nice with quests that increase players inventory - or getting a backpack etc
		* Sperrylite mining starts at 3 per hit to much also easy minigame

		// Inputs
		* Allow TAB out from Town Hall Build Menu	
		* Purple rain should have a F to show requrements
		* Would like to add stack with coal etc to smelter by right click

		// Tweaks
		* Rope and Burlap could take longer to craft
		* Iron Axe/ Pickaxe should require more than 5 iron	
		* Bit to low agency requirement for unlocking valley exit
			
		// Additional Content
		* Sheets for Large Chest recipe?
		* Missing Platinum Axe/Pickaxe recipe	

		// Bugs
		* Exiting the menu with ESC when the chose amount window is visible, won't close it.
		* Ramiro and Manuela are not in the valley like ever
		* Game crashed - after fixing the museum and getting the fix broken pillar quest

		* Ball person Notice of "Manuaela and Ramiros house" - typo? inThimbleton one word

		// Mechanics
		* Fast double click in mini game should be valid, now a delay is needed
		* Maybe unlocking stuff in research should be based on amount of total items gathered of a type over time not the amound you got on you?	
		* Drinking an item (or filling it) if no space for empty bowl/glass should not be allowed rather than sending it to lost and found?
		* Maybe unlocking a map part should open the map menu automatically?
		

		// Visuals
		* Deer keeps moonwalking backwards
		
		// LOOK INTO
		Played your game, latest version got stuck here... https://imgur.com/MahzJjb
		Got stock in wall behind ramiros house

		When picking up stuff from crafters the notice text is under the output panel
		Trying to pick up stuff with full inventory should make different sound and notice player better of failure to do so. Also makes axe sound hitting wood/rock if clicking anywhere
		dragging from anywhere in the inventory+ drags the selected item out into the world to drop, maybe you should require the player to drag from the item.
		Using a tool in a crowded area makes harvesting fail (instead check more than the closest item to see if any is harvestable with the tool)
		spyglass I - is there a version II ?
		consuming a blueberry drink with full inventory (having 2+ drinks) discards the glass - should keep it
		blueberries at camp seems to spawn multiple times making stacks (also seems to happen to some clay and stone)
		failing minigmae cutting wood should have another sound than hitting stone?
		E- to interract and fixing cost does not show at the fireplace at the hilltop or the hill
		maybe sitting should speed up recovery?
		Right clicking a stack in inventory moves all stacks of same type, should only move all of the clicked stack
		Shift clicking items in the inventory changes sprint on/off - which it prob shouldnt
		Trying to fix ramiras farm - gets you unavalible notice but costs you BOUNCE each time
		Minor - When fixing a torch you can light it before it is completed

		Step Sounds are off in the town - wooden floor sound on grass areas a bit random


		- NEW

		NOT AN ISSUE when placing stuff I get option above a stack say for soft wood 190 but when placing only the stack is placed
		Did you spell turmeric wrong by mistake?
		Piñjon adds only 1 bounce instead of 10
		oRES AND mORES selling crystals for 0 sparks (seems that multiple buy screens pop up when there is several items on the table, like crystals		)
		Would be nice to teb out from trade for sparks menu
		Lots of duplicate items, my save ali file was 45.5Mb




		******************************
		Minesweeper GO Pro Cons

			TheOreh/Opex/0,12,46/220,180,140
		-no ping or delay, game only loads to the server after you win it
		-no cheaters usually (partly cuz of anticheat), or the dev, who has contacts with active players, bans cheaters in a short period of time
		-no incidents when your board moves up and down like on wom mobile
		-tournaments

			Llama
		 The main reason for playing it over different apps is that it has good stats and leaderboards, though WoM also has this. And the reason for playing minesweeper Go 
		 over WoM would be that minesweeper Go is optimised for mobile so is a bit more responsive than WoM. Although this does depend on other factors like what device is used.
		******************************
		
		// DATABASE
		* Figure out a way to not load to many Levels at a time - Introduced Collections
		
		// Cloud Firestore Rules - Also needs in game correlating rules
		* Allow writing if
			- Player is power user = paying or playing a lot?
			- Level starts with number between 06-20
			- Status == Pending (Players always place the level in Pending status) Might allow admin status to place as Approved?
			- Upwotes == 0 && Downvotes == 0 - When level is uploaded it has to start at no Votes
			- 
		* Allow updating if
			- Update specific value 
				- Pending -> Approved if Upvotes - DownVotes > 10
				- DifficultRating if newValue >= OldValue -MaxChange &&  newValue <= OldValue +MaxChange 
				- DownVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- UpVotes if newValue == OldValue +1 
				- PlayCount if newValue == OldValue +1 
				-- Do Not allow updating Level, LevelID, CreatorId

		//ISSUES
